- Short responses, quick private experiments, mobile-first interfaces

## Limitations

- Smaller local models can hallucinate and may produce incorrect or biased outputs.
- Performance varies significantly by browser/device GPU capability.
- Large context windows and long generations may stress mobile memory.
