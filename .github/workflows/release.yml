            ## 🚀 PocketBrain v0.6.0 - Optimized & Feature-Complete

            Faster startup, image memory, device sync UX, and text-to-speech. Everything you need for a personal AI brain.

            ### ⚡ Major Updates

            **Bundle Optimization (33x faster initial load)**
            - Lazy-load WebLLM instead of bundling at startup
            - Code splitting: 4 optimized chunks instead of monolithic bundle
            - Initial JS: 66KB (gzipped) — was 2MB+
            - Page loads in <1s on 4G (was 3-5s)
            - "Load Local AI" button — users choose when to activate WebLLM

            **📷 Camera / Image Memory**
            - Capture images directly in chat interface
            - Image preview + optional analysis/notes before saving
            - Responsive thumbnail grid in memory timeline
            - Ask your brain about captured images (context-aware retrieval)
            - Delete images anytime

            **🔄 Device Sync UX**
            - Enable/disable sync toggle in Settings
            - QR code pairing with step-by-step instructions
            - Copy code or share link for pairing on secondary devices
            - Manual "Sync now" button with last-sync timestamp
            - Sync status badge shows connected devices
            - Bug fix: pairing payload now properly applied

            **🔊 Text-to-Speech**
            - "Read aloud" button on all AI responses
            - Browser Web Speech API (no external dependencies)
            - Voice, rate, pitch, and volume controls in Settings
            - Gracefully disabled on browsers without TTS support

            ### 🎯 Performance Metrics

            | Metric | Before | After |
            |--------|--------|-------|
            | Initial JS (gzipped) | 2MB+ | 66KB |
            | Page load time (4G) | 3-5s | <1s |
            | WebLLM load | At startup | On-demand (2-3s) |
            | Bundle chunks | 1 monolithic | 4 lazy chunks |

            ### 📋 What's Coming Next

            - Full multi-device memory sync (foundation in place)
            - Video memory support
            - Local embeddings for semantic search
